## Objective
Validate and improve online Maze2D performance by determining whether gains are driven by data collection policy (collector), learner updates, or both. Primary focus: characterize and explain SAC's collector advantage over Diffuser and design targeted Diffuser improvements.

## Active Hypotheses (max 3)
- H1 (falsified): Diffuser collector dominates — generates better replay for any learner.
  - Status: falsified (3-seed swap matrix, h256)
  - Evidence AGAINST: diffuser replay main effect `0.8194` vs SAC replay `0.9097` (n=12/collector, h256) — `runs/analysis/swap_matrix/swap_matrix_20260219-231605/swap_matrix_results.csv`
  - Evidence AGAINST: SAC endpoint pairwise L2 > Diffuser in `11/12` consolidation cells — `runs/analysis/collector_stochasticity/consolidation_q10_s40_r8_h192/consolidated_overall_summary.json`
  - Next discriminating test: N/A — already falsified; 5-seed matrix will confirm stability.

- H2 (partially supported): Diffuser learner/planner advantage with shared replay.
  - Status: partially supported (3-seed swap matrix, h256)
  - Evidence FOR: best cell `warmstart|sac_her_sparse→diffuser` = `0.9722 ± 0.0481` — `swap_matrix_results.csv`
  - Evidence FOR: learner main effect diffuser `0.8819` vs SAC `0.8472` (n=12/learner, h256)
  - Next discriminating test: promote to 5 seeds; run waypoint/diversity diagnostics.

- H3 (strongly supported): SAC collector advantage is control-aware (better goal-directed coverage), not raw action noise.
  - Status: strongly supported (multi-seed consolidation + visual falsification + ablation grid interaction analysis)
  - Evidence FOR: Diffuser action pairwise L2 > SAC in `11/12` cells; SAC endpoint pairwise L2 > Diffuser in `11/12` cells — `consolidated_overall_summary.json`
  - Evidence FOR: SAC reaches near-goal (`<=0.1`) ~61 steps faster on average where both succeed (seed-0, 4/6 queries) — `visual_check_phase1_seed0_q6_s20_r6_h192/steps_to_goal_threshold_0p1_summary.json`
  - Evidence FOR (ablation grid): EMA+adaptive closes Diffuser gap from 19pp to **2.8pp within-condition** (best Diffuser 0.639 vs SAC 0.667). These interventions address *control responsiveness*, not action noise — confirming the mechanism is temporal control quality.
  - Evidence FOR (ablation grid): Action scaling (alpha>1.0, increasing raw magnitude) is neutral-to-harmful (+53% clip fraction at alpha=1.4), disconfirming a raw-magnitude deficit explanation.
  - Evidence FOR (ablation grid): Strong beta×adaptive interaction (magnitude 0.083) — smoothing alone hurts, adaptive alone neutral, **together** they produce +11pp. This synergy = reducing jitter (EMA) enables earlier re-commitment to better plans (adaptive) — both are control-quality interventions.
  - Next discriminating test: promote best condition (alpha=1.0, beta=0.5, adaptive=True) to multi-seed swap matrix to confirm gap closure holds end-to-end.

## Required Environment (minimal, no secrets)
```bash
D4RL_SUPPRESS_IMPORT_ERROR=1
MUJOCO_GL=egl
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/mujoco_compat:/root/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PYTHON=third_party/diffuser/.venv38/bin/python3.8
# Must be set before process start — script-level env mutation is insufficient for mujoco_py dynamic libs
```

## Current Best Result (non-smoke only)
- Metric: success@h256 = `0.9722 ± 0.0481`  (n=3 seeds, condition=warmstart+SAC-replay→diffuser-learner)
- Artifact: `runs/analysis/swap_matrix/swap_matrix_20260219-231605/swap_matrix_results.csv`
- Commit: `b9cdd15`
- Notes: 3-seed matrix; promote to 5 seeds for stable confidence intervals

## Running / Active Jobs
- None (idle)

## Ablation Grid Results (COMPLETE — grid_20260221-134801)
- 12 conditions: alpha∈{1.0,1.2,1.4} × beta∈{0.0,0.5} × adaptive∈{0,1}, seed_0 diagnostic (6q×6r, h192)
- SAC baseline (same checkpoint): `success=0.7222`, endpoint_l2=0.4747
- Diffuser baseline (alpha=1.0, beta=0.0, adapt=False): `success=0.5278`
- **Best Diffuser**: `alpha=1.0, beta=0.5, adapt=True` → `success=0.6389` (+11pp vs baseline, -8pp vs SAC)
- Key interaction: **EMA smoothing (beta=0.5) alone does NOT help** (0.5278→0.50); **adaptive alone does NOT help** (0.5278→0.5278); **BOTH together** → +11pp
- Alpha scaling: neutral to mildly counterproductive; alpha=1.4 causes 53% clip fraction — saturation
- Artifact: `runs/analysis/ablation_grid/grid_20260221-134801/ablation_grid_results.csv`

Full ranking (success rate):
| Condition | success | hit@0.1 | clip |
|---|---|---|---|
| alpha1.0, beta0.5, adapt=True | **0.6389** | 0.33 | 0.04 |
| alpha1.4, beta0.5, adapt=True | 0.5833 | 0.36 | 0.53 |
| alpha1.2, beta0.5, adapt=True | 0.5556 | 0.36 | 0.36 |
| alpha1.0, beta0.0, adapt=False (baseline) | 0.5278 | 0.36 | 0.04 |
| alpha1.0, beta0.0, adapt=True | 0.5278 | 0.31 | 0.04 |
| alpha1.2, beta0.0, adapt=True | 0.5278 | 0.31 | 0.36 |
| alpha1.4, beta0.0/0.5, adapt=* | 0.50 | ~0.30-0.39 | 0.53 |
| alpha1.2, beta0.0/0.5, adapt=False | 0.4722 | 0.36-0.39 | 0.37 |

## Next Experiment (runnable)
```bash
# Intent: promote swap matrix from 3→5 seeds to strengthen H2 confidence intervals (blocking open Q#1)
D4RL_SUPPRESS_IMPORT_ERROR=1 MUJOCO_GL=egl \
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/mujoco_compat:/root/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
  third_party/diffuser/.venv38/bin/python3.8 scripts/exp_swap_matrix_maze2d.py \
  --seeds 0 1 2 3 4 --collectors diffuser sac_her_sparse \
  --learners diffuser sac_her_sparse --modes warmstart frozen \
  --device cuda:0 --base-dir runs/analysis/swap_matrix/5seed_$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

## Secondary Experiment (after 5-seed matrix)
```bash
# Intent: bake best ablation params (beta=0.5, adaptive=True) into swap matrix and re-run 3-seed
# to test whether EMA+adaptive closes the collector gap end-to-end (not just on diagnostic seed_0)
# Command TBD after 5-seed matrix completes
```

## Open Questions (ranked by blocking priority)
1. Is 3-seed matrix sufficient for paper CI, or must 5-seed run complete? — blocking: yes — resolves with: 5-seed matrix + CI comparison
2. Does replanning cadence/horizon explain Diffuser controllability gap? — blocking: no — resolves with: `scripts/exp_replan_horizon_sweep.py`
3. Is `eval_samples_per_query>1` needed to decouple query-coverage from single-trajectory success? — blocking: no — resolves with: re-run stochasticity diagnostics with `--eval_samples_per_query 4+`
4. What concrete Diffuser modification targets the endpoint-diversity gap? — blocking: no — resolves with: mechanism analysis post-ablation
5. How much of Diffuser collector quality depended on privileged multi-candidate selection defaults? — blocking: no — resolves with: 1-seed and 3-seed reruns under non-privileged defaults vs old defaults

## Debug note: query-0 visual vs numeric mismatch (validated)
- User concern:
  - query-0 looks geometrically cleaner for Diffuser, but steps-to-hit (`<=0.1`) showed SAC faster.
- Verification status:
  - Recomputed first-hit steps directly from `query_00_trajectories.npz`; matched prior result exactly.
  - Therefore implementation is correct for "first timestep reaching threshold".
- Query-0 reconciled facts:
  - First-hit steps:
    - Diffuser hits: `[131, 140, 134, 161, 150, 155]`
    - SAC hits: `[157, 121, 92, 84, None, None]`
  - Geometric efficiency to first-hit (successful rollouts):
    - Diffuser path-to-hit length mean: `2.21`
    - SAC path-to-hit length mean: `3.13`
  - Temporal speed to first-hit:
    - Diffuser mean step displacement to hit: `0.0153`
    - SAC mean step displacement to hit: `0.0285`
  - Post-hit wandering (full-horizon rollout continues after hit):
    - Diffuser after-hit path length mean: `0.248`
    - SAC after-hit path length mean: `1.472`
- Interpretation:
  - Diffuser is often more path-efficient/geometrically cleaner on q0, but SAC can reach `<=0.1` earlier by moving faster per timestep.
  - Visual plots use full-horizon trajectories (not stop-at-hit), so SAC can look worse due to post-hit wandering despite early hit in some rollouts.

## Debug note: query-0 conservative-action hypothesis (validated)
- User question:
  - Is Diffuser's smaller per-step displacement mainly caused by action clipping?
- Verification status:
  - Checked code path: both methods are clipped before `env.step`, but SAC actor is already bounded by tanh.
  - Query-0 audit confirms clipping is minor and not the primary cause.
- Query-0 action-magnitude audit facts:
  - t0 stochastic action samples (`n=20`):
    - Diffuser raw action L2 mean `0.9314`, clip rate `0.000`.
    - SAC raw action L2 mean `1.0791`, clip rate `0.000`.
  - Rollout actions (`6 rollouts x 192 steps`):
    - Diffuser raw action L2 mean `0.7726`, clip fraction `0.0165`.
    - SAC raw action L2 mean `1.2191`, clip fraction `0.0000`.
  - Replay action-magnitude context (seed0 exports):
    - Diffuser replay L2 mean `0.7512` (close to uniform-[-1,1]^2 baseline `0.7653`).
    - SAC replay L2 mean `0.8451` (higher-magnitude distribution).
- Additional control-cadence caveat (SAC query-0 sensitivity):
  - `decision_every=1`: hit-step mean `100.5` over `6/6` successes, displacement mean `0.0118`.
  - `decision_every=16`: hit-step mean `111.4` over `5/6` successes, displacement mean `0.0240`.
- Interpretation:
  - Conservative Diffuser magnitude is not a manual-clipping artifact in this setup.
  - More plausible drivers are method-level behavior: diffusion denoising + plan selection objective (wall hits, final-goal error) and collector control cadence choices.

## Debug note: planner selection semantics (clarified)
- User concern:
  - Does Diffuser do post-hoc selection across multiple environment rollouts, which would be invalid at test time?
- Clarified behavior:
  - Diffuser executes one environment trajectory at a time (no parallel env rollout selection).
  - At each replan step, Diffuser may sample multiple imagined plans from the diffusion model and select one before acting.
  - Selection objective in code is lexicographic `(wall_hits, final_goal_error)`.
- Important context split:
  - Main Diffuser probe/eval path uses `maze_arr` and defaults `wall_aware_planning=True`, `wall_aware_plan_samples=8`, so multi-candidate imagined-plan selection is enabled.
  - `scripts/analyze_collector_stochasticity.py` explicitly calls planner with `maze_arr=None`, forcing effective single-candidate planning (`n_candidates=1`) in that analyzer.
- Interpretation:
  - The prior visual/stochasticity analyzer comparison does not use multi-candidate wall-aware selection in rollout execution.
  - Fairness discussions should distinguish "multiple model samples per decision" from "multiple environment rollout attempts."

## Update: non-privileged planner selection patch (2026-02-20)
- Change applied:
  - Removed wall-hit term from Diffuser plan-selection objective.
  - Plan selection now uses final-goal-error only across imagined candidates.
  - Defaults changed to non-privileged single-candidate planning:
    - `wall_aware_planning=False`
    - `wall_aware_plan_samples=1`
- Files changed:
  - `scripts/synthetic_maze2d_diffuser_probe.py`
  - `scripts/exp_swap_matrix_maze2d.py` (explicitly pins `wall_aware_planning=False`, `wall_aware_plan_samples=1` for swap-matrix launches)
- Rationale:
  - Align collector behavior with inference-time assumptions that do not require privileged maze-layout logic for action selection.

## Update: old-vs-new default smoke (2026-02-20)
- Scope:
  - Compared old default behavior (`wall_aware_planning=True`, `wall_aware_plan_samples=8`) vs new non-privileged defaults (`wall_aware_planning=False`, `wall_aware_plan_samples=1`) using the same trained checkpoint + replay artifact.
  - Budget: `6 queries x 3 rollouts`, rollout horizon `128`, success threshold `0.2`, replan every `16`.
- Readout (new minus old):
  - success rate: `-0.0556` (`0.2778` vs `0.3333`)
  - min goal distance mean: `+0.0568` (`0.7802` vs `0.7234`)
  - final goal distance mean: `+0.0567` (`0.7824` vs `0.7257`)
  - wall hits mean: `+18.7778` (`47.5` vs `28.72`)
  - first-hit (`<=0.1`) counts: `1` vs `1` (not enough paired hits for robust speed inference)
- Caveat:
  - This is a small smoke result, not a stable estimate; per-query effects were mixed (some queries improved under new defaults).
  - Next step is to promote to at least 1-seed full eval, then multi-seed confirmation.

## Logging policy
- Append-only history: `HANDOFF_LOG.md`
- Living snapshot: `docs/WORKING_MEMORY.md` (this file — overwrite/compact, do NOT append)
- Record commit hash + subject + scope in HANDOFF_LOG when committing; update this header accordingly.
- Nested `EBM_OnlineRL/` follows the same pattern with its own files.

## 2026-02-20T14:48:18.435Z
### Objective
- Preserve the current validation-cycle state and hand off remaining callback-driven Maze2D experiment work for future agents.

### Changes
- Updated `HANDOFF_LOG.md` with new handoff content (`+70` lines).
- Updated `docs/WORKING_MEMORY.md` with current progress/context (`+25/-2`).
- Added untracked handoff artifacts: `gpt_pro_handoff_bundle_20260220.zip`, `gpt_pro_handoff_bundle_20260220/`, and `memory/`.
- Captured current execution state: `pending=0`, `running=0`, `done=1`, `failed=0`, `blocked=1`, `canceled=0`.
- Preserved active plan tail (tasks 7-15) covering script alignment, smoke checks, callback mini-pipeline, mismatch fixes, and full validation launches.

### Evidence
- Repo context: `/root/ebm-online-rl-prototype` on branch `master`.
- Command: `git status --porcelain=v1`
- Key output: `M HANDOFF_LOG.md`, ` M docs/WORKING_MEMORY.md`, `?? gpt_pro_handoff_bundle_20260220.zip`, `?? gpt_pro_handoff_bundle_20260220/`, `?? memory/`.
- Command: `git diff --stat`
- Key output: `HANDOFF_LOG.md | 70 +...`, `docs/WORKING_MEMORY.md | 25 +...--`, `2 files changed, 93 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)`.

### Next steps
- Provide the exact attached plan text/path so tasks can be mapped precisely (instead of inferred from filenames).
- Confirm the exact `relay-long-task-callback` command/interface expected in this repo.
- Confirm whether `HANDOFF_SUMMARY_FOR_NEXT_CODEX.txt` should be recreated in this validation cycle.
- Continue remaining plan tail: run smoke verification, harden aggregation/experiment scripts, execute mini end-to-end callback pipeline, fix any schema/analysis mismatches, then launch full validation runs with ongoing `docs/WORKING_MEMORY.md` and `HANDOFF_LOG.md` updates.
